## Rustbridge Web Scraper

### Problem

There's data on a website that you want to use, but getting it out of the website would be tedious and error-prone.

### Overview

* Request an Amazon wishlist-like page and extract titles and prices from the command line
* Use an HTTP client library (Hyper) to make the requests
* Use an HTML DOM parser (Select) to extract the data
* Process the data using Iterators

### Event

Completed during the inaugural [Rustbridge Pittsburgh 2016](https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/320).
